								<h3>Beach basketball <h3>
							</header>
							<p>In basketball, you try to acquire more points than your opponents by shooting upwards with the Wii Remote. There are two modes including 3-Point Contest, which supports 1-4 players, and Pickup Game, which supports 1-2 players. In 3-Point Contest your Mii stands behind the three point line and the player makes appropriate motions with the Wii Remote in order to try and get the basketball in the hoop. The player with the most points at the end of the round wins the game. Each round is timed. Pickup Game is a three on three basketball game. The player won't control each Mii with the joystick on the nunchuck, but rather the Mii will move automatically (similar to Wii Sports tennis). All the player has to do in Pickup Game is shoot, steal, pass, and block.</p>

								<h3>Archery</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In each of Archery's stages is a piece of food that can be seen far away, though finding it alone can be a challenge. When the player eventually finds the food item, they have the option of shooting it, though doing so will be very challenging. Hitting the piece of food will reward the player with quite a lot of points.</p>

								<h3>Swordplay</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Ever since the Wii Remote was first revealed, players have wanted to simulate a real, 1:1 sword game, though were unable to because of the controller's inability to perform 1:1. With the Wii MotionPlus, however, the developers have managed to replicate it nearly flawlessly, and thus implemented a sword game in Wii Sports Resort. You'll play as one of your Mii characters and either play in the game modes Dual, Speed Slice, or Showdown.</p>

								<h3>Power Cruising</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this game you hold the Wii Remote and Nunchuck as if you were grasping the handles of a jetski. You perform the same motions as you would in a real jetski as well. In the game your goal is to get through the goals before time runs out. This is one of the few games that requires the use of the Nunchuck. You'll tilt the two controllers in order to go in the corresponding direction. The director of Wii Sports Resort, Katsuya Eguchi, was the man who also headed the Nintendo 64 video game Wave Race 64. In an interview he claimed that Power Cruiser is more expansive than the Nintendo 64 classic. When questioned in 2008 if there would ever be another Wave Race game, Shigeru Miyamoto explained that he felt the power cruiser game in Resort would appeal to a much broader audience.

								<h3>Table Tennis</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This game is similar to the Wii Sports tennis game and Wii Play's table tennis title, but with added Wii MotionPlus control. The onscreen Mii will automatically go towards the ping pong ball but it'll be the players job to hit it in the right direction so that it heads back to the player on the opposing side of the table. The mode was revealed prior to E3 2009 on Nintendo's Japanese website via a video that also showcased golf. While you're playing, spectators will watch in the background. A pool is stationed behind the table that serves no significant purpose.</p>

								<h3>Wakeboarding</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this mode you'll be pulled by a boat on the ocean, and hold the Wii Remote in its classic position (a la Super Paper Mario, Wario Land: The Shake Dimension). You can twist the Wii Remote left and right in order to go in that direction and move the controller in variety of directions to get points when lifted in the air. The game was first revealed at E3 in 2009..</p>
